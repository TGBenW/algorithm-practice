**Summary**  
Given an `n x n` grid of digits (as strings), mark a cell as `X` if:
- it's **not** on the border, and
- its value is **strictly greater** than each of its four neighbors (up, down, left, right).

**Approach**  
Use the **original grid for comparisons** and write marks into a **separate copy** so earlier replacements do not affect later checks.

**Example**  
Input:
1112
1912
1892
1234

Output:
1112
1X12
18X2
1234
