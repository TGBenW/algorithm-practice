**Summary**  
Given `keyboards[]`, `drives[]`, and budget `b`, find the **maximum** sum `k + d â‰¤ b` where `k` from keyboards, `d` from drives. If impossible, return `-1`.

**Approach (O(n log n + m log m))**  
Sort `keyboards` ascending and `drives` descending.  
Use two pointers: walk keyboards up, and move drives pointer down while sum exceeds `b`. Track best sum.
