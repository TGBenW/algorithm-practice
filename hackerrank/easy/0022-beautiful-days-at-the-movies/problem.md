**Summary**  
Given start day `i`, end day `j`, and divisor `k`, find how many days `x` in `[i, j]` satisfy:  
`abs(x - reverse(x)) % k == 0`.  
A day is *beautiful* if this condition holds.

**Approach**  
1. Iterate all days in range `[i...j]`.  
2. Reverse the current day number.  
3. Check divisibility of their absolute difference by `k`.  
4. Count how many satisfy the condition.

**Examples**  
- `i=20, j=23, k=6` â†’ 2 (days 20, 22 are beautiful)
