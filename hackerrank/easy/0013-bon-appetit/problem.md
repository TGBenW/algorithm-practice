**Summary**  
Given a bill array, an index `k` that Anna didn't eat, and the amount `b` that Brian charged Anna, determine if the split was fair.  
If fair, print `Bon Appetit`; otherwise print the integer refund `b - (sum(bill except k) / 2)`.

**Examples**  
- Input: `bill=[3,10,2,9], k=1, b=12` → Output: `5`  
- Input: `bill=[3,10,2,9], k=1, b=7`  → Output: `Bon Appetit`
