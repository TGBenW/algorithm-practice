**Summary**  
Given the character’s natural jump height `k` and an array of hurdle heights, return the minimum number of potion doses required to clear all hurdles. If `k` is already high enough, return `0`.

**Examples**  
- Input: `n=5, k=4`, hurdles = `[1, 6, 3, 5, 2]` → Output: `2`  
- Input: `n=5, k=7`, hurdles = `[2, 5, 4, 5, 2]` → Output: `0`
