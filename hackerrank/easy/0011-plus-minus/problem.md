**Summary**  
Given an array of integers, calculate the fractions of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print each fraction with 6 decimal places.

**Example**  
Input: `arr = [-4, 3, -9, 0, 4, 1]`  
Output:  
0.500000
0.333333
0.166667

**Notes**  
- Ratios should be computed as `count / n`.  
- Output should preserve 6 decimal places even for whole numbers.
