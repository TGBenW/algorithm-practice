**Summary**  
Given two lowercase strings `s` and `t`, and an integer `k`, determine if `s` can be transformed into `t` using exactly `k` operations:
- **Append** a lowercase letter.
- **Delete** the last character.

**Rules**  
If `k` is large enough to delete and rebuild both strings entirely, return `"Yes"`.  
Otherwise, find the common prefix length and calculate how many deletions and additions are required.  

**Approach**
1. If `k >= s.count + t.count`, return `"Yes"`.
2. Find the longest common prefix length between `s` and `t`.
3. Compute total required changes =  
   `(s.count - commonPrefix) + (t.count - commonPrefix)`.
4. If `k >= totalChanges` and `(k - totalChanges) % 2 == 0`, return `"Yes"`.  
   Otherwise, return `"No"`.

**Complexity**
- Time: O(n), where n = min(len(s), len(t))  
- Space: O(1)
